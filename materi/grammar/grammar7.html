            The **Past Future Continuous Tense** is used to describe an action that was predicted, planned, or expected to be happening at a specific time in the future from a past perspective.  
            It is formed using **would be + verb-ing** or **was/were going to be + verb-ing**.  
            Example: "She said she **would be studying** at 8 PM." / "They **were going to be traveling** to Japan last summer, but they canceled the trip."  
            The negative form is made using **would not (wouldn’t) be + verb-ing** or **was/were not going to be + verb-ing**.  
            Example: "He said he **wouldn’t be working** late that night." / "She **wasn’t going to be attending** the conference."  
            Questions are formed using **Would + subject + be + verb-ing?**  
            Example: "Would she be studying at that time?" / "Was he going to be working on the project?"

            The **Past Future Perfect Continuous Tense** is used to describe an action that would have been happening for a certain period of time in the past, viewed from a past perspective.  
            It is formed using **would have been + verb-ing** or **was/were going to have been + verb-ing**.  
            Example: "She said she **would have been studying** for three hours by 8 PM." / "They **were going to have been traveling** for two days before they arrived."  
            The negative form is made using **would not (wouldn’t) have been + verb-ing** or **was/were not going to have been + verb-ing**.  
            Example: "He said he **wouldn’t have been working** for that long." / "She **wasn’t going to have been practicing** enough before the competition."  
            Questions are formed using **Would + subject + have been + verb-ing?**  
            Example: "Would he have been studying all night?" / "Was she going to have been working for five years before retiring?"
